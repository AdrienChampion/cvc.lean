/-! # Term-creation specification

This module defines the data describing how to build the term constructors for a cvc5 term kind,
and the environment extension storing that data.

A specification entry is written once, in the *typed* form, and describes everything both layers
need:

- the sort shape of each argument and of the result,
- the type and size variables the operator is polymorphic in, with their refinement classes,
- which n-ary variants to generate.

The untyped signature is *derived* from the typed one by erasure: every shape becomes a plain
`Untyped.Term`. See `Cvc.Proto.Gen` for the generators.

/-- Natural-number expression describing a sort index, such as a bit-vector size.

Size variables are bound by the enclosing `OpSpec`, either as a size binder or as an operator
index. Arithmetic is needed by operators whose result index is computed: `BITVECTOR_CONCAT` sums
its arguments' sizes, `BITVECTOR_EXTRACT` yields `hi - lo + 1`, `BITVECTOR_REPEAT` yields `n * k`.

Subtraction is `Nat` subtraction, so it truncates at zero.

  /-- Truncated difference of two sizes. -/
  | sub (lft rgt : SizeExpr)
  /-- Product of two sizes. -/
  | mul (lft rgt : SizeExpr)
  /-- The operator's own arity: how many term arguments it was applied to.

  `BITVECTOR_FROM_BOOLS` builds a bit-vector one bit per argument, so its result's size is not a
  function of its arguments' sorts but of how many there are. In the fixed-arity constructor this
  is a literal; in the n-ary one it is the term array's size, which makes that signature depend on
  a runtime value.

/-- Sort shape: `Typ` extended with type variables and size arithmetic.

A shape describes the sort of an argument or result *as the typed layer sees it*. Two operations
are defined on shapes:

- **erasure**, which forgets the shape entirely and yields the untyped signature, where every
  argument and the result are plain `Untyped.Term`s;
- **rendering**, which turns the shape into the Lean type indexing a `Typed.Term`.

/-- Surface notation for an operator in the `smt!` DSL.

The generated grammar rule is named `…smtOp.<shape>.<id>`, and the expander in `Cvc.Proto.Ext`
dispatches on the last three components of that node kind. That convention is what lets the
grammar be generated per theory while the expansion logic stays written once.

  When the operator also has an n-ary variant, the bracket form `sym[a, b, …]` is generated

/-- A value parameter: a plain Lean argument, passed to the constructor as-is.

Constructors take data that is not a term — the `Bool` of a boolean literal, the `String` of a
symbol's name, the numeral behind a bit-vector. Such a parameter is emitted unchanged in both
layers, since there is no sort to erase.

untyped one, which has no index to constrain.

/-- Everything needed to generate the typed and untyped constructors for one term kind.

The entry is keyed by `id`, the name of the generated function; `kind` is the `cvc5.Kind`
constructor the term is built with, and is checked to exist when the entry is declared.
-/
structure OpSpec where
  /-- Name of the generated function, such as `and`. -/
  id : Name
  /-- Constructor of `cvc5.Kind`, such as `AND`.

  For an entry built by a `TermManager` method this is still the kind the resulting term *has*,
  even though the term is not built by applying it.
  -/
  kind : Name
  /-- `TermManager` method building the term, when it is not built by applying `kind`.

  Nullary constants have no `mkTerm` form: `SET_EMPTY` is `mkEmptySet`, `PI` is `mkPi`, and so on.
  Such a method takes the term's own sort where the sort cannot be inferred from arguments.
  -/
  tmFn : Option Name := none
  /-- Shape whose sort the `tmFn` method takes, when it is not the result's own.

  Most constructors take the sort of the term they build, but not all: `mkEmptySet` takes the set
  sort while `mkEmptySequence` takes the sequence's *element* sort.

  sizeVars : Array Name := #[]
  /-- Operator indices, bound as explicit `Nat`s ahead of the term arguments.

  An indexed operator is built by applying an `Op` carrying these values, rather than by applying
  the kind directly. They are what SMT-LIB writes as `(_ extract hi lo)`.

  The `N` suffix suits an operator whose n-ary form is the same operation at greater arity. It
  does not suit one where the distinction is singular versus plural: `bvFromBool` takes a bit and
  `bvFromBools` takes several.

/-- Type variables occurring in the result but in no argument.

Such a variable is lost by erasure: the untyped constructor takes the result sort explicitly while
the typed one recovers it from its index. Applying a kind always infers the sort from the
arguments, so this is empty for every `kind`-built entry, and `op%` rejects one where it is not.
It is exactly the constructors — the `tmFn` entries — that need it.

modules of both layers.
