As for sets, `bagMember`, `bagCount` and `bagMake` take the element first.

/-! ## Higher-order operators -/

/-- The image of a bag under a function. -/
op% bagMap {α β} (f : fn α β) (b : bag α) : bag β := BAG_MAP

/-- The elements of a bag satisfying a predicate, with their multiplicities. -/
op% bagFilter {α} (p : fn α bool) (b : bag α) : bag α := BAG_FILTER

/-- Folds a binary function over a bag, from an initial value. -/
op% bagFold {α β} (f : fn α (fn β β)) (init : β) (b : bag α) : β := BAG_FOLD

/-- Whether every element of a bag satisfies a predicate. -/
op% bagAll {α} (p : fn α bool) (b : bag α) : bool := BAG_ALL

/-- Whether some element of a bag satisfies a predicate. -/
op% bagSome {α} (p : fn α bool) (b : bag α) : bool := BAG_SOME

/-- Partitions a bag into the equivalence classes of a binary predicate.

The predicate is expected to be an equivalence relation on the bag's elements; the result holds
one bag per class. Its sort is `Bag (Bag α)`, which is why the element sort needs an order.
