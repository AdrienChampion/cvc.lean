/-! # Sequences over nullables, typed

Each lifted operator has its plain counterpart's signature with an `Option` around every argument
and around the result, and nothing else changed. The lift is **strict**: `none` unless every
argument is `some`.

The sequence *term* becomes nullable, not its elements — `Option (Array α)`, not `Array (Option α)`.
