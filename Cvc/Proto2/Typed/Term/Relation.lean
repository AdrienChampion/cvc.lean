/-! # Relations, typed

A relation is indexed by `Rel α β` — a set of tuples whose components are `α ++ [β]`. See
`Types/Relation.lean` for why the last component is split off; in short, it makes "drop the last
component" something unification can do, which is what lets `relJoin` be a signature rather than a
type-level program.

**The set operators are restated here rather than reached through `Set`**, so working with a
relation never means leaving the relation world. `relUnion`, `relMember` and the rest are the set
operators at a relation's index; `relToSet` is there for the two that genuinely leave it, `setMap`
and `setFold`, whose results are arbitrary sets.

cvc5 marks every relation-specific kind experimental.

/-! ## Tuples -/

/-- The components of a tuple, in order, along with the index they denote.

`last` and `cons` are the only builders, so the number of terms and the number of components the
index describes stay in step.
-/
structure Tup.Components (α : List Type) (β : Type) where
  private mk ::
  private terms : Untyped.Terms

namespace Tup.Components

/-- The final component. -/
def last (component : Term β) : Tup.Components [] β := ⟨#[component.erase]⟩

/-- Adds a component in front of the ones collected so far. -/
def cons (component : Term α) (rest : Tup.Components αs β) : Tup.Components (α :: αs) β :=
  ⟨#[component.erase] ++ rest.terms⟩

end Tup.Components

/-- The tuple whose components are the given ones.

A component that is itself a tuple stays one: `Tup [α] (Tup [β] γ)` denotes
`(Tuple α (Tuple β γ))`, not a three-component tuple.
-/
def mkTup (components : Tup.Components α β) : Env (Term (Tup α β)) :=
  T.mkTuple components.terms

/-! Reading a tuple back apart. The index is a list, so each of these is a component position that
unification or `List.length` can compute — no type-level program is needed, unlike the product
index where a middle component has no accessor at all.
-/

/-- The first component.

`α :: αs` is a constructor pattern, so the position is `0` whatever follows.
-/
def tupFst (tuple : Term (Tup (α :: αs) β)) : Env (Term α) :=
  tuple.erase.tupleSelect 0

/-- The last component.

Its position is the length of `α`, which computes: a `List Type` is an ordinary runtime value, so
this works at any arity without the index having to be concrete.
-/
def tupLast (tuple : Term (Tup α β)) : Env (Term β) :=
  tuple.erase.tupleSelect α.length

/-- Every component but the first, as a tuple.

A projection rather than a selection, since the result has more than one component in general.
Composing it with `tupFst` reaches any position.
-/
def tupRest (tuple : Term (Tup (α :: αs) β)) : Env (Term (Tup αs β)) :=
  -- components `1 … αs.length + 1`: all of `αs`, then `β`
  tuple.erase.tupleProject ((Array.range (αs.length + 1)).map (· + 1))



/-! ## Crossing to and from sets

Both directions are the identity on terms: a relation *is* a set of tuples, and only the index
differs. They are here for the operators that leave the relation world, and for interoperating with
code written against `Set`.
-/

/-- Reads a relation as the set of tuples it is. -/
def relToSet [Ord (Tup α β)] (rel : Term (Rel α β)) : Term (Set (Tup α β)) := rel

/-- Reads a set of tuples as the relation it is. -/
def relOfSet [Ord (Tup α β)] (set : Term (Set (Tup α β))) : Term (Rel α β) := set



/-! ## Relational operators -/

/-- Composition: `lft`'s last component and `rgt`'s first are the same `mu`, and both are dropped.

The shared `mu` is cvc5's joinability requirement, stated in the signature rather than checked at
run time.
-/
def relJoin (lft : Term (Rel α μ)) (rgt : Term (Rel (μ :: α') β'))
: Env (Term (Rel (α ++ α') β')) :=
  T.relJoin lft.erase rgt.erase

/-- Cartesian product: every pairing, with the components appended. -/
def relProduct (lft : Term (Rel α β)) (rgt : Term (Rel α' β'))
: Env (Term (Rel (α ++ β :: α') β')) :=
  T.relProduct lft.erase rgt.erase

/-- The components of a transposed relation: the whole list, reversed. -/
abbrev transposed : (α : List Type) → (β : Type) → Type
  | [], β => Rel [] β
  | hd :: tl, β => Rel (β :: tl.reverse) hd

/-- Reverses every tuple's components. -/
def relTranspose (rel : Term (Rel α β)) : Env (Term (transposed α β)) :=
  T.relTranspose rel.erase

/-- Transitive closure of a homogeneous binary relation. -/
def relTclosure (rel : Term (Rel [α] α)) : Env (Term (Rel [α] α)) :=
  T.relTclosure rel.erase

/-- The identity relation over a unary relation's elements.

`Rel [] α` *is* the unary relation — the split index says so directly, with no separate
one-component tuple type needed.
-/
def relIden (rel : Term (Rel [] α)) : Env (Term (Rel [α] α)) :=
  T.relIden rel.erase

/-- The elements of a binary relation related to at least `size` others. -/
def relJoinImage (rel : Term (Rel [α] β)) (size : Term Int) : Env (Term (Rel [] α)) :=
  T.relJoinImage rel.erase size.erase

/-- Partitions the relation, putting tuples that agree on the given components in the same part.

Answers a set *of relations*. The indices choose what is compared and so do not reach the result's
sort.
-/
def relGroup [Ord (Rel α β)] (indices : Array Nat) (rel : Term (Rel α β))
: Env (Term (Set (Rel α β))) :=
  T.relGroup indices rel.erase

/-- Folds each group of tuples that agree on the given components.

The groups are `relGroup`'s, but the answer is a set of *accumulators* rather than a set of
relations: `f` runs over each group's tuples starting from `init`, and the result collects one
value of `gamma` per group.

`f` is a function-sorted term, which `Term.lambda` builds. Its two arguments are a tuple of the
relation and the accumulator, in that order, and its result is the new accumulator — so `gamma` is
fixed by `init` and by `f`'s codomain together, and nothing about the fold has to be checked at run
time.

The indices only say what is grouped, so they do not reach the result's sort. With none of them
every tuple is in one group, which is an ordinary fold over the whole relation.
-/
def relAggregate [Ord γ] (indices : Array Nat) (f : Term (Tup α β → γ → γ)) (init : Term γ)
  (rel : Term (Rel α β))
: Env (Term (Set γ)) :=
  T.relAggregate indices f.erase init.erase rel.erase

/-- Equi-join: the product, keeping the pairings whose given component pairs agree.

The result's sort is the product's, since the pairs only filter.
-/
def relTableJoin (indices : Array (Nat × Nat)) (lft : Term (Rel α β)) (rgt : Term (Rel α' β'))
: Env (Term (Rel (α ++ β :: α') β')) :=
  T.relTableJoin indices lft.erase rgt.erase

/-- Projects every tuple onto the given components, in the order given.

Sort-erased: which components an index array selects is a runtime value, so no index describes the
result. `Untyped.Term.typeCheck` puts one back on.
-/
def relProject (indices : Array Nat) (rel : Term (Rel α β)) : Env Untyped.Term :=
  T.relProject indices rel.erase



/-! ## The set operators, at a relation's index

to be built or constrained.
