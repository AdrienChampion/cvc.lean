/-! # Function-application constructors, typed

A function's index is the curried arrow `α → β → γ`, which `Typ.toSrt` flattens into the SMT sort
`(-> α β γ)`. `applyN` takes an `Args` spine and so covers every arity; `apply`/`apply2`/`apply3`
are the fixed-arity spellings over it.

**They flatten**, inheriting that from the sort-erased constructors: applying a term that is
already an `APPLY_UF` appends to its children rather than nesting. So the `CoeFun` chain `f a b c`
builds the same flat term `applyN` does, and stays clear of the function-sorted intermediates that
would otherwise force a higher-order logic.

**`Args φ β` is the arguments that take a `φ` down to a `β`**, and the spine you build is what says
how many there are. `done` is an explicit base case, so nothing ever has to ask whether `β` is
"still an arrow" — the question that makes drop-last on a right-nested index intractable.

Stopping the spine early is a **partial application**, and it is sound: cvc5 accepts fewer
arguments than the arity and gives the term the remaining function sort, which is exactly the `β`
the spine computes.

/-! ## Applying any number of arguments -/

/-- Arguments taking a function of index `φ` down to a result of index `β`.

`last` and `cons` are the only builders, so the terms collected and the arrows consumed stay in
step — and `last` carrying an argument is what makes "at least one" structural, where an array
would have needed a side condition.

  private terms : Untyped.Terms
  -- carried, not re-proved at the use site: `applyN` needs it and only the builders know it
  private nonEmpty : 0 < terms.size

namespace Args

/-- The final argument. Its `β` is whatever the function has left, so stopping here is a partial
application. -/

/-- Applies a function to the arguments a spine holds.

Saturating when they fill the domain, and a partial application otherwise — the spine's `β` is the
remaining function index in that case, and cvc5 gives the term that very sort.

There is always at least one argument, since `Args.last` carries one. That is what `APPLY_UF`
requires, and it costs no side condition here.
