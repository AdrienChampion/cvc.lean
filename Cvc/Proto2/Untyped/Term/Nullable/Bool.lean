/-! # Boolean and sort-generic over nullables, sort-erased

One lifted constructor per liftable operator, `<id>?`, each answering `none` unless every argument
is `some`. That strictness is `nullable.lift`'s semantics and not a choice made here.

**`equal?` is not `Option`'s equality.** The lift is strict, so `equal?` of two `none`s is `none`,
not `some true`. The same goes for `distinct?` and for `ite?`, which is strict in its condition.
